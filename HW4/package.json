  "description": "A command line application that takes in four command line arguments. The first is either -e or -d (for encrypt and decrypt, respectively). The second is either a message to encrypt or a ciphertext to decrypt. The third is the key. The fourth is an initialization vector. If encrypting, the program assumes the string argument is a utf-8 encoded string and outputs the AES256-CBC encoding of the input, as a hexadecimal string. If decrypting, the string argument is assumed to be a hexadecimal representation of a byte sequence, and the output should be the decrypted string.",
